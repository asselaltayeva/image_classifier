# Image Classifier

A machine learning based image classifier that uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify parking lot images as either empty or occupied.

## Overview

This project implements a binary image classification system designed to detect parking space occupancy. The classifier uses scikit-learn's SVM algorithm with grid search optimization to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features

- Binary image classification (empty vs. not_empty parking spots)
- Automated hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Image preprocessing and resizing for consistent input dimensions
- Train/test split with stratified sampling
- Performance evaluation with accuracy metrics
